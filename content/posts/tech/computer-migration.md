-- SYSTEM BENEFITS according to seller --
Lenovo claims a 18.3 hour battery life; I have experienced closer to 10 hours with constant use of Remote Desktop Connection.
Pack a USB-C battery capable of Power Delivery and you can go for days without a power point in sight.
Uses a FIDO Biometrics fingerprint reader to protect your passwords and system.

I would like to play around with **Linux** on my Dell once I've moved over. I'm excited.
