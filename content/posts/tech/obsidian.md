OKAY look I've sort of used Obisidian on and off for the last ehhhh two years I think and I haven't settled into a groove because the learning curve to use it was kind of steep and I couldn't be bothered migrating everything from Notion. Also, without a suitable cross-platform sync that I haven't been able to implement without breaking the bank, I haven't fully committed to migration. Well, [Notion](/notion/) it is.
