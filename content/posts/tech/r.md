My note on [VSCode](/vscode/) outlines the process of setting up R in VSCode. It was a bit painful, but it is what I gave up to escape the sad white IDE that is RStudio. But, RStudio is still good, it just makes a lot more sense for me personally to use R in VSCode where I already do everything else. The happiness I felt when I started typing up R on VSCode was strangely euphoric.
