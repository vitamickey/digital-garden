Ah, \\(\LaTeX\\). I pronounce it as "lay-tech" or "lah-tech", never "lay-tex". Every math girl's dream. 

# Setup

- MiKTeX for building TeX
- [VSCode](/vscode/) as text editor
- I have Strawberry Perl and I think it's related to LaTeX but I honestly Don't Remember why
    - ah ok I think based on this article, [Using Latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html), you need Perl to run `latexmk`, a Perl script, "If you use cross-references, you often have to run LaTeX more than once, if you use BibTeX for your bibliography or if you want to have a glossary you even need to run external programs in-between."
        - I have used bibtex so this makes sense
- [GitHub](/github/) for any big boy projects or things I want to share
