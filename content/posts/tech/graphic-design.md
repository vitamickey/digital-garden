A lot from Kel Lauren??

## FONTS AND TYPEFACES! yeet

OH BOYYY I can display my fave fonts here and their respective merits okay, I'll put these in some other time. I always use the word fonts where I should be saying typefaces, so I will use "typeface" as much as I can from here on out.

### Site

- [Gelasio](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gelasio) by Eben Sorkin is the current font for this website.
  - Compatible with Vietnamese, because I would like to learn Vietnamese
  - It was previously Lora, but I wanted to change it to something that was a bit less round and with slightly narrower glyphs? characters? idk terms
- [Avara](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/) using for title headers on this website
- [Xanh Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Xanh+Mono) bc it's made for vietnamese and I think it looks really nice. Only downfall is that its readability is pretty Bad.
  - Considering replacing this with [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) or [M PLUS Code Latin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/M+PLUS+Code+Latin)

### Pretty typefaces <3

- [Avara](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/) as prev. mentioned. A font that has no curves, only straight lines
- [Cantique](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/cantique/) Viet support
- [Wremena](https://typefaces.temporarystate.net/preview/Wremena)
- [Junicode Bold Condensed](https://open-foundry.com/fonts/junicode_bold_condensed)
- [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) seems very cool and I'd like to use it... Viet support

### Typefaces with a story in my life

- Britannic Bold (in primary school, I said this was my fave font LOL but that's not the case now)
- Lora (used for my old studyblr HAHA)
- Comic Sans (used to write a series of scathing anonymous notes during high school that I was accused of writing. Maybe I will write about that one day, that wasn't the best time)

### Other typefaces with a story

- [Occlusion Grotesque](https://bjoernkarmann.dk/occlusion-grotesque), a typeface being made by a tree.
- [22/22](https://2222.seabellfoundry.com/), a collection of 22 fonts being released once at a time for free throughout end of 2022, or donate and receive all fonts released at time of donation.

### Where to get fonts (for free)

- [Velvetyne](https://velvetyne.fr) has sooooooo many nice ones I would use so many of them!!!
- [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com/), fonts I have not used but it's also a good place
- Google Fonts is gr8 lol super basic but they work great and have a lot of compatibility!! Google owns everything in the world except for the stuff Mark Zuckerberg owns!!!! HAha
