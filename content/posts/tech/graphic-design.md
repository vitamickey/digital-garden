I just want to be able to refer to graphic design resources quickly. 
A lot from Kel Lauren??

# FONTS AND TYPEFACES!!!!

OH BOYYY I can display my fave fonts here and their respective merits okay, I'll put these in some other time. I always use the word fonts where I should be saying typefaces, so I will use "typeface" as much as I can from here on out. 

## Pretty typefaces <3

- [Avara](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/avara/) (using for headers on this website, a font that has no curves, only straight lines)
- [Cantique](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/cantique/)
- [Wremena](https://typefaces.temporarystate.net/preview/Wremena)
- [Junicode Bold Condensed](https://open-foundry.com/fonts/junicode_bold_condensed)

## Typefaces with a story in my life

- Britannic Bold (in primary school, I said this was my fave font LOL but that's not the case now)
- Lora (used for my old studyblr HAHA)
- Comic Sans (used to write a series of scathing anonymous notes during high school that I was accused of writing. Maybe I will write about that one day, that wasn't the best time)
- 

## Other typefaces with a story

- [Occlusion Grotesque](https://bjoernkarmann.dk/occlusion-grotesque), a typeface being made by a tree.
- [22/22](https://2222.seabellfoundry.com/), a collection of 22 fonts being released once at a time for free throughout end of 2022, or donate and receive all fonts released at time of donation.

## Where to get fonts (for free)

- [Velvetyne](https://velvetyne.fr) has sooooooo many nice ones I would use so many of them!!!
- [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com/), fonts I have not used but it's also a good place
- Google Fonts is gr8 lol super basic but they work great and have a lot of compatibility!! Google owns everything in the world except for the stuff Mark Zuckerberg owns!!!! HAha
