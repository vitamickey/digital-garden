A course by Moore Theological College, but I'm going through a version with my mentor.

## Study 1: The Book of Books

      <td> </td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Former</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Latter</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### 3.2 The New Testament

### 4. What does the Bible claim about itself?

**Research** Read Jeremiah 1:1-12.

*\1. Why did God call Jeremiah to be a prophet?* To: pluck up and break down, destroy and overthrow, and to build and plant the nations and kingdoms.

*\2. Why was Jeremiah able to speak with authority?* Because God delivered His words to him. God commanded him.

*\3. How did Jeremiah know that his words would come true?* God told him that He would be with him and deliver him.
