Welcome to my lil' digital garden! This is a place where I would like to learn and grow. 

Some places to start on this website would be my post about [digital gardens](/digital-garden/) or my first post [So, it began](/so-it-began/) on why I made this website.

Here, I'd like to add a list of my favourite notes that I've published.
