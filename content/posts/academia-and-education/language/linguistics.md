I think linguistics is really cool. There is an entire story behind how I got interested in linguistics, which I would like to write up at some point.

- [OzCLO](/ozclo/)
- QTE Wycliffe
- Talking to a ling prof from Griffith
- Naomi's parents
- Graeme's wife's parents

For now, this is Ê•going to be a sort of quick guide based on my linguistics intro subject at uni, but I will only be trying to revise the topics below so these may not be super comprehensive.
