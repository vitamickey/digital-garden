I study mathematics.

## Stuff that confuses me still

- High school-level content
  - Concavity
  - Sample proportion questions that they give to Year 12's
  - Integration by recognition. I can't really EXPLAIN it.
  - Anything finance.
- Necessary vs. sufficient conditions
- ODEs
- What exactly is a series? I still don't know sometimes.

## Other maths things I might make a note about

Mostly as a tutoring aid, maybe when kids are like "what is this thing help me please".

- The unit circle, though, everyone already loves the unit circle.
- INTEGRATION IS AREA UNDER CURVE
