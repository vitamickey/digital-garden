I try to be cruelty-free with my cosmetics products. It's kinda hard. It's like, I want to use good quality, cruelty-free, affordable, versatile products. "Clean" products also tend to have botched expiry dates, but are often products with more sustainable packaging. So, I am trying my best here. Personal references for me when I want to buy new make-up or skincare (what might be on my wishlist), and to be reminded of products I already use and like. I have a lot of stuff on [Pinterest](https://pin.it/4x7qog6) which is nice and all but is also kind of limiting in that it's so heavily visual. 

# Makeup masterlist

Sorted by product type and then a few subheaders:

## Structure
Perhaps will contain a short blurb about my thoughts around the make-up category. 

**Current:** 

- the product(s) I currently own and am using.
  
**Yes:** 

- has worked for me

**No:** 

- has not worked for me

**Maybe so:** 

- wishlist/products I am interested in

## Concealer

**Current:** 

- Colourpop Pretty Fresh 90w. Good match for my skin, a smidge orange. 

**Yes:**

- Juvia's Place in I think J18? A touch grey as well. Texture was nice on my skin. 

**No:**

- Hynt Beauty Medium Tan. Used it a while ago and it worked for shade but not for texture as much. 

**Maybe so:**

- KVD Good Apple Concealer Medium 141. Haven’t purchased (only used sample) but is a perfect match for my skintone, a true olive leaning yellow. Probably will purchase during a year with a special occasion bc MONEY. 
- Rare Beauty 230N is a touch grey for me but olive undertones are good. Might be too drying. 
- Rose Inc? not sure what shade but it looks nice
- Flower Beauty
- Too Faced BTW
- Kosas Revealer concealer (controversial due to expiry issues)

## Foundation

**Current:** 

- my concealer LOL

**Yes:** 

- tbh have not used a standout foundation that I would repurchase. 

**No:** has not worked for me

- Colourpop Pretty Fresh Tinted Moisturiser in 12w. Probably needed the shade up, but like it did work, since the coverage is light-medium.
- Kjaer Weis in Illusion. Too orange? Which is annoying bc it’s supposed to have olive undertones. Idk, like, I got away with it, but it really is quite orange on me, and a tad dark. 

**Maybe so:**

- Kosas Face Oil in 5.5?
- Kjaer Weis in a different shade?? Or one of the other formulas?
- Flower Beauty if I can find a shade match
- Too Faced BTW if I really need a proper foundation??
- 

## Lipstick

I want BROWNS and reds. No pinky brown nonsense, no peaches. Anything slightly pink will look super pink on me. I also don’t really like oranges/terracottas that much. Though pinks/peaches/orange-based colours work well with my complexion, they do not go with the colours of my wardrobe, which is why it is such a struggle to find good lippies.

**Current:** 

- Flower Beauty in Blossom. Bought on a whim from CW, and it’s the perfect subtle but hydrating colour for everyday. Can literally wear in any situation. 
- Pat McGrath Mattrance? In Flesh 3. It’s super nice, but not CF. Bought secondhand off Reddit.
  
**Yes:** 

- Colourpop:
    - Cutie Fruity
    - Cherry Pickin
    - Lay over is a smidge pink for me but still works
- Rituelle de Fille:
    - Written in Blood. It's a really nice product and the bold blue-based red actually kinda worked for me. Didn’t lean orange, which is something I look for in a bolder red lipstick. Though it did lean a smidge too pink once worn out. 
- MAC:
    - Brick-o-la (a bit too pink tho)
    - Mocha (but too pink for personal preference right now)
    - Chilli (but too orange?)
- Smashbox:
    - Safe word (maybe a bit too neutral)

**No:** 

- Bright colours in general
- Colourpop:
    - Sike (too bright)
    -  
- Pat McGrath:
    - Omi
    - 1993?
- MAC:
    - Velvet Teddy and basically all the usual "this is the perfect MLBB shade from MAC" suspects

**Maybe so:** 

- Kosas in like all the shades hahaha
- Colourpop
    - Thousand Percent
