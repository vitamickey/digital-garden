I use a bullet journal. Yes, I got into the craze when I was in Year 9 at school and studyblr was taking the internet by storm. It was quite the time.

My first iterations of bujoing I recall being kinda ugly ngl.

Now, I follow the Ryder Caroll method, and not the pretty artsy method. Not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact, I loved doing that for many years, and it really helped ground me through some pretty dark and dire times.

## My setup

- Book
  - A6 Stalogy
- Pens
  - Uni Jetstream SXR-5 is my daily driver
  - Tombow Fudenosuke Brush Pen in Soft and Hard tips
  - Tombow Dual Brush Pens sometimes
  - Muji 0.5 Retractable Gel Pens sometimes

## Philosophy

I discovered the Actual bullet journal method funnily enough watching a WheezyWaiter video.

- rapid logging
