# Cons of one room I visited

- Room small for price (have found larger rooms for cheaper, not enough storage for me personally) and the food areas (kitchen, place for me to store my food) are quite small too
- Kind of dark living areas? I would like a bit more natural light indoors, since I'd be spending a lot of time at home
- Too overbearing of a landlord - seeking independence, but landlord was motherly in nature

- Plan and prepare! A lot!
- Inspect multiple properties.
- Lots of windows.
- Pre-book deliveries.
- Reach out to friends/family.
- Bring speakers.
- Look after yourself.

## Nerdfighteria Discord Server advice
- Spice/seasoning collection is necessary.
- Figure out how to feed yourself.
- Don't walk away when cooking.
- "Everyone has a weird roommate, and sometimes that weird roommate is you".
- Be dictatorial with cleaning.
- Clean continuously.
- Do together!
- Make timelines if people are in charge of one area. Be reasonable.
- Don't over-commit.

> one of the things for me that created the most challenges in rooming situations was this: people come in and assume their manner and timeline of doing chores is the **right way**.
> 
> the time they leave dishes dirty is the right time.
> 
> the place they leave dirty dishes is the right place.
> 
> etc.

> getting along with roommates means letting go of that self-righteousness, and working out mutually agreed upon standards of behavior (without acting like the ones you prefer are the *standard by which the others should be judged*). it is a very strong lesson in subjectivity ðŸ¤£
