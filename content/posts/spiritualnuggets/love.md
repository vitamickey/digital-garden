I feel like a lot of stuff I have been reading or hearing has been about love. That makes sense, given love is the core of who God is. God IS love. Of course I am learning a lot about love. 

The classic is 1 Corinthians 13. Anything without love is nothing. 

Let all that you do be done in love, [1 Corinthians 16:14](https://esv.org/1Corinthians16:14). 

Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth. [1 John 3:18](https://esv.org/1John3:18)
