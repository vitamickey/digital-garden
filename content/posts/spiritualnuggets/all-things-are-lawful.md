The idea that all things are lawful has been playing on my mind a lot. 

> “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything. ([1 Corinthians 6:12](https://www.esv.org/1Corinthians6:12/))

> “All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up. ([1 Corinthians 10:23](https://www.esv.org/1Corinthians10:23/))

Paul's teachings here encourage Christians to truly be discerning about what they do.
