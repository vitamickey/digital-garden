See [Calvinism](/calvinism/).

(From Pastor)

Because man is dead in sin (totally depraved) he is unable to initiate a response to God; therefore, in eternity past, God elected certain people to be saved. Election and predestination are unconditional; they are not based on man's response as man is unable to respond, nor does he want to.

- Romans 8:29-30.
- Romans 9:11.
- Ephesians 1:4-6.
- Ephesians 1:11-12.
