Questions to ask:

- What have you learned about each other lately — stories, habits, character traits?
- How have you each grown in your relationship with Jesus since you started dating?
- Are you both committed to abstaining from any form of sexual immorality?
- What flags, if any, have others raised about your relationship?
- What obstacles are keeping the two of you from getting married?
- Are you each being driven by your own desires, or by God’s desires for you?
- In what ways is your relationship different from non-Christian relationships?
