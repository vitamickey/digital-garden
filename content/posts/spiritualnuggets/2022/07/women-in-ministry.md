1 Tim 2??

Rom 16

- vs 22: author was Tertius
- vs 1-2 PHOEBE
  - deacon, benefactor, patron
  - Paul entrusts her to deliver (?) the letter
  - trustworthy

1 Cor 11:2-3

- Head == Authority
- Christ is the head of every person
- If you cover your head you’d be acting like a woman. Gender roles
- On covering head for mostly Roman women == I am sexually available
  - Like taking wedding ring off in public

- Cannot be challenged
- Celebrating gender distinction
- Respect for cultural sexual or moral purity
- Commitment to integrate men and women for God’s glory

1 Tim 2:11-15

- One end: radical feminism
- Other end: women are pregnant in the kitchen
- Vs 12: affirming this would mean it extends outside church - lobbying against female ceos, politicians, lecturers, police officers etc.
  - Greek verb: “I do not permit” could translate to “I am not permitting (now)”, like progressive (present tense indicative)
  - Context of disruptive worship
  - Only instance of that Greek word “authority” which means asserting authority or dominating (I.e. acting on their own power to teach)

- Women weren’t listed sometimes in long lists of proof of things happening because women of the day weren’t considered trustworthy
