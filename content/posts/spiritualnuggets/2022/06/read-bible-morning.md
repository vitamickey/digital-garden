I am not a morning person

Every inch of my being longs to stay up until the quiet hours of the AM. There is something so serene about the world past midnight. Living in a quiet residential area, the early hours of the morning are a quiet bliss backed by crickets and only interrupted by distant train noises or the occasional backstreet hoon race.

So, if I can so easily wax poetic about the nights, why do I read my Bible in the mornings? 

# It focuses my mind on God for the entire day.

Even if for a short time in the morning, it means I have spent at least a portion of my day on God.

Giving God the first part of my day, almost every day, helps remind me that my time is not my own.

# I am good at forgetting to do things (such as read the Bible).

In Romans, Paul talks about ???



If I don't do it first thing, the odds 

# I am good at forgetting words.

I will probably not really remember what I read the night before. I can barely remember what I ate for dinner the night before. Why would I remember a whole Bible study lol.

# It slows me down.

# It reminds me that my time belongs to God.

Related to the previous point.

# It means I can give my best to God.
