I get the feeling that this is kind of obvious, but I am talking about instances where I have read a passage and gone, "Wow, the way that the author talked about their emotions, thoughts, situation, etc. is something I would like to adapt into my life too." So, basically these are all from the epistles but whatevs.

From Youth camp, Romans 7:21-25. Models a response to our own sinful nature.

From personal reading, 4th of June, 1 Corinthians 15:10. Models talking about God's grace and work in us.
