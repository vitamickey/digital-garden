Today, I started reading 2 Corinthians, and like, wow. There are times when I am in awe at God's word, but this was a time where I was TRULY felt so in awe of what I was reading.

In the first half of 2 Corinthians 1, Paul talks about the afflictions and suffering he's gone through. There are a few key truths I have taken from this:

# Suffering makes us learn to rely on God

I have gone through a lot. People who know me know this. But even so recently as this last month have I felt this to be true. My faith has been thoroughly stretched to its limits over such a short period of time, but my reliance on God has skyrocketed along with that. Suffering sucks, but God changes me for the better each time. So, my hope sits with Him, every time. See [2 Corinthians 1:8-11](https://esv.org/2Corinthians1:8-11).

# The comfort we receive from God in our afflictions helps us comfort others in theirs

I could write a related note on this. It's sort of a side tangent to the main idea of this note. 

I still have a question: what does it mean to share in Christ's sufferings?
