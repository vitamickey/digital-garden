#### My actual procedure I followed?

For 500g setting sugar, and a bit more than that of strawberries

- Preheat oven to 180C
- Wash strawberries with damp towel (prevents water absorption)
- Cut strawberries into pieces, mash lightly, mix with sugar, leave to sit at room temp (12hr or overnight recommended but nah)
- Wash jars with warm soapy water and dry with tea towel
- Prep pan with water, warm up to simmer, turn off heat
- Place saucers in fridge? Freezer?
- Place strawberries and sugar in pot with juice of half a lemon
- Low heat until sugar is fully dissolved
- While waiting, place jars in oven and lids in boiling pan
- Once sugar is dissolved, boil for 5-10min, turn off heat, and test on back of cold saucer. If not set enough, then turn heat back on and boil for 2min at a time, turn off, test again
- Meanwhile, take jars and lids out after 10min, place on clean towels
- Spoon scum off top of jam
- Add small knob of butter
- Spoon jam into jar whilst both jam and jar are warm
- Leave to cool
