I like music! 

# Making music

# Guitar (acoustic)



# Instruments I've played and thus have skills in

- Voice (always)

    Okay I know this kind of doesn't count but I am primarily a singer so

- Bassoon (2015 - 2019)
- Clarinet (2013 - 2017??)
- Piano (2007? - 2016 but with a break in the middle idk)
- Recorder lol
- Ukulele sort of

# Pieces I've played or sung

Like there's probably a lot I've forgotten but these are pieces I remember

## Primary school

I don't remember THAT much of what I played in primary school. It was a while ago and I didn't actually write down any of this stuff when I was younger

- Caterpillar of Society
- Edelweiss
- So Long, Farewell
- Dare to Dream?
- Pirates of the Caribbean Theme

    We played this as a finale during our final ever concert and the trumpets stuffed up the intro like three times in a row, as in, so badly we needed to restart the piece three times. Quality content.

- How to Train Your Dragon Theme
- Poker Face by Lady Gaga???
- The Tempest
