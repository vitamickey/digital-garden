I am a Christian. What does that mean?

## What I believe, basically

wip.

There is one God, the one who created that thing you may know as the Bible.
Our world was created by God, as have each and everyone one of us.
But humanity has fumbled pretty hard.
Instead of listening to God, we decided, as Gabriella Montez in High School Musical 2 once said, that we gotta go our own way.
In the Bible, that's what sin is.
By going our own way and sinning, we separate ourselves from God, the way that rebelling against your parents separates you from them.
But, unlike our biological parents, God ultimately decides what happens to our souls when we die.
And, if we've lived our lives going our own way by sinning, once we die in the physical sense, God punishes our souls with an eternal death.
