The Dunning-Kruger Effect is the psychological phenomenon wherein people display a cognitive bias towards their own abilities: those with limited competence or knowledge will overestimate their abilities and demonstrate great confidence in themselves, whilst those with increasing or expert-level competence are reserved in self-confidence as they acknowledge the limitations of their knowledge.
