I got into K-Pop quite a while ago, but since becoming more serious about my faith have often walked back from idolatry to just music enjoyment. I have also recently been thinking I should pay more attention to the meaning of the songs I listen to, even if they're in a different language. That is going to take... a lot of work. But I think it will start with filtering out the new songs that come into my sphere of attention and going through the entire discography of Red Velvet and LOONA to sort out the ones I should keep around vs the ones I could chuck. 

This is gonna take a while. I have already tried to go through LOONA's ++ album and like I'm a bit conflicted bc they're all just love songs? I guess most pop songs are about romance. Are the lyrics really that worthwhile? That's why I like listening to K-Pop in large part: you can just enjoy cool sounds without thinking too much about the meaning. But I realised lately that even though I don't understand the meaning, those who know Korean do. I sometimes get irked when people sing along to really bad English songs, but those people also probably just listen to the song bc it sounds good.

I reached a bit of a breaking point recently, so I am currently on a K-Pop fast. K-Pop songs are in my brain far too much of my life. I am missing a LOONA comeback. See you all in July.
