I am an absolute Github noob, but like, I'm trying my best. 

When I created this website, I didn't realise I should have created the `hugo new site` in a cloned repository that was already on my computer, so, I am using the second answer of this stack overflow question to do it.

My .gitignore file came from here
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Hugo.gitignore
I am only semi-confident in my .gitignore file for the website, but like, it's fine.
