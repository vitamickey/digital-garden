### My actual procedure I followed?

For 500g setting sugar, and a bit more than that of strawberries

Preheat oven to 180C
Wash strawberries with damp towel (prevents water absorption)
Cut strawberries into pieces, mash lightly, mix with sugar, leave to sit at room temp (12hr or overnight recommended but nah)
Wash jars with warm soapy water and dry with tea towel
Prep pan with water, warm up to simmer, turn off heat
Place saucers in fridge? Freezer?
Place strawberries and sugar in pot with juice of half a lemon
Low heat until sugar is fully dissolved
While waiting, place jars in oven and lids in boiling pan
Once sugar is dissolved, boil for 5-10min, turn off heat, and test on back of cold saucer. If not set enough, then turn heat back on and boil for 2min at a time, turn off, test again
Meanwhile, take jars and lids out after 10min, place on clean towels
Spoon scum off top of jam
Add small knob of butter
Spoon jam into jar whilst both jam and jar are warm
Leave to cool

Oh! I think Aunty Elsa gave me tips the year I made the cha guo!

Hereâ€™s what she wrote to me... 

Hi Julia   I never made those but it's same dough as Jin doys. Just have to use pink colouring roll into balls and fill with Do SAR (red bean sweet paste from a tin) or. Peanuts roasted in oven  crushed and sugar added  flattened onto banana leaf and steamed over hot water.    Ingredients are 1 packet rice flour - the one with green writing -  two thirds cup caster sugar  2 cups hot water and pink colour

Dissolve sugar in water  Add colour first then add to flour. Keep 1 and half tablespoons flour reserved to work the dough as you roll and fill.  Add colouring carefully as too much would be too bright 

Jin doys are rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried turning and pressing until pale golden colour     Have to be very careful with young child around.   Needs 2 bottles peanut oil. Then after have to strain oil into bottles when cool and use for normal stir fry.    I picked up Ella from second day school today and she has just fallen asleep after reading Enid Blyton to her.   Nicole picking Luca up from kindy and should be home soon. Goong he fut Choy. For tomorrow.  Xxx

1 Feb notes:
- oil needs to be SUPER low
- move the balls constantly - burns on bottom of pot
