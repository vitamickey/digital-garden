I think you call this a stack, where you talk about applications you use and their setup. So, I am gonna write a university stack, or a general productivity stack, but this is my VSCode stack, which in essence is a list of extensions I use and my setup. 

- **Colour Theme:** *[Rouge](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josef.rouge-theme)*
-- I like navy and the soft pink is really nice. 
--I also have used *Horizon Bright* by jolaleye if I ever want to use a light theme (so, not super often, but enough to say I like it as a theme). This isn't available on VSCode marketplace anymore, but other versions have been made of it. 
-- I am trying out *[Natural](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naturalTheme.natural-theme)* by Marco Franzese
-- Name: *[Paddy Color Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yile-ou.paddy-color-theme)* has a really nice variety of colour themes too, which I use occasionally.
- **Font:** *Fira Mono*
- **File Icon Theme:** *[Field Lights Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sveggiani.vscode-field-lights)*
- **LaTeX:**
-- *[LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)* for ease of LaTeX editing, building, viewing outputs, etc. 
-- *[LaTeX language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=torn4dom4n.latex-support)* for syntax highlighting and such. 
- **Hugo:**
- **Other**
-- I have some **Jupyter** extensions installed but I don't really use Jupyter that much. I needed it for one statistics class iirc, but for statistics I prefer to use R separately to VSCode (at most, I will edit code in VSCode). 
-- I have *[Music Time for Spotify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.music-time)* installed, but I don't really use it. 
-- I have all the basic **Python** extensions installed but, again, only needed for one class. I don't use Python now, and I am quite bad at it anyway lol. 
-- I recently downloaded the **Go** extension since I need to use it to download `hugo-extended`, but like, I don't think I need the extension. 
-- Oh, and I use **GitHub**, but you don't need extensions for that haha.
